Vocaloid models in three.js

Models obtained from:

The models are in pmd/pmx which is the file format that miku miku dance (a japanese program to pose and animate vocaloid models)

In order to get them to work in three.js.
Use blender and [blender_mmd_tools](https://github.com/sugiany/blender_mmd_tools)

Good screencast by yomotsu: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFb5F8brFLw](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFb5F8brFLw)

My inital problem was an [ascii error](http://i.imgur.com/9h2woGw). Since the model and everything associated with it was in japanese and blender doesn't handle those character so you have to rename everything.
